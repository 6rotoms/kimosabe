# Kimosabe UI

Built with React + TailwindCSS

### Features

- Responsive design for mobile users

### Running Locally

This UI is a standalone client that communicates with the API. Run `docker-compose up -d` to set up all required dependencies.
Then run 'npm start' to start the dev server on port 8000, and it can be visited at http://localhost:8000. This will run with
the dev environment and will communicate with the local server at port 3000.
